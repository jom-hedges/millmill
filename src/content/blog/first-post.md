Rip Torn is a face without a name. Recognizable in classic movies of the 90s and early-aughts, but his filmography dates back to the 1950s. I taught a language class last semester that utilized pop culture videos to engage students’ active learning skills. The curriculum’s problem though is the video clips are dated (heavily pixellated), and they rely on the TV show <i>Friends</i>. While discussing a unit on space exploration, I began playing the movie <i>Men in Black</i>, just on a whim. A girl in the front row enjoyed it, so she asked to continue watching it. At the end of class, we got to introduction of Agent Zed, played by Rip Torn.

<i>Men in Black’s</i> plot centers around an alien bug’s hunt for the jewel of the galaxy found on Orion’s Belt. Orion happens to be a cat of one of the galaxy’s most-important extraterrestrial beings. In the picture, he’s the man seated on the right.

The alien bug (dressed in white) kills the galaxy’s VIP. Actually kills both restaurant patrons. Later at the morgue, the man’s face opens up to reveal a tiny extraterrestrial being, who dies before revealing the jewel’s location to Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith’s characters. Even though Rip Torn’s character does not feature prominently in the movie, this story plot excellently encapsulates the poem’s shape-shifting, dissociative qualities that focus on a marble bust that decays into a dilapidated Styrofoam castle.
