Rip Torn is a face without a name. Recognizable in classic movies of the 90s and early-aughts, but his filmography dates back to the 1950s. I taught a language class last semester that utilized pop culture videos to engage students’ active learning skills. The curriculum’s problem though is the video clips are dated (heavily pixellated), and they rely on the TV show Friends. While discussing a unit on space exploration, I began playing the movie Men in Black, just on a whim. A girl in the front row enjoyed it, so she asked to continue watching it. At the end of class, we got to introduction of Agent Zed, played by Rip Torn.

Men in Black’s plot centers around an alien bug’s hunt for the jewel of the galaxy found on Orion’s Belt. Orion happens to be a cat of one of the galaxy’s most-important extraterrestrial beings. In the picture, he’s the man seated on the right.

The alien bug (dressed in white) kills the galaxy’s VIP. Actually kills both restaurant patrons. Later at the morgue, the man’s face opens up to reveal a tiny extraterrestrial being, who dies before revealing the jewel’s location to Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith’s characters. Even though Rip Torn’s character does not feature prominently in the movie, this story plot excellently encapsulates the poem’s shape-shifting, dissociative qualities that focus on a marble bust that decays into a dilapidated Styrofoam castle.

##### <b>Liner Notes concerning Stevie Howell's "Rip Torn"</b>
Stevie Howell’s “Rip Torn” was originally published on October 26, 2012 in The Walrus. The poem mythologizes Rip Torn’s life in a way that viewers skitter down the London tube and receive telegraphed images of the Queen’s jowls.

The opening stanza places the people en masse (hoi polloi) as Medusa gazing at a almost marble lithic production of the Queen. The poem uses stone-imagery throughout, and the idea that things are transpiring, changing, or surfaces can be deceiving.

After reading the poem, I turned to Wikipedia to read about lithic flakes. Copied here is the intro paragraph from the lithic flake entry:

>In archaeology, a lithic flake is a "portion of rock removed from an objective piece by percussion or pressure," and may also be referred to as simply a flake, or collectively as debitage. The objective piece, or the rock being reduced by the removal of flakes, is known as a core.  Once the proper tool stone has been selected, a percussor or pressure flaker (e.g., an antler tine) is used to direct a sharp blow, or apply sufficient force, respectively, to the surface of the stone, often on the edge of the piece. The energy of this blow propagates through the material, often (but not always) producing a Hertzian cone of force which causes the rock to fracture in a controllable fashion. Since cores are often struck on an edge with a suitable angle (<90°) for flake propagation, the result is that only a portion of the Hertzian cone is created. The process continues as the flintknapper detaches the desired number of flakes from the core, which is marked with the negative scars of these removals. The surface area of the core which received the blows necessary for detaching th flakes is referred to as the striking platform.

Basically the people perceive value in a shit-sandwich. Throughout the poem the people unblink and drool over useless, shiny things. Th people perceive a diamond, and don’t realize they’re getting fleeced.

Returning back to the first stanza, appearances are late. The bust’s marble facade is revealed, or equated to a Styrofoam castle. The reader or viewer in this case arrives fifty years late to the party. The adhesive has worn, so the styrofoam structure is visible.

Perhaps it’s too late to wake up. To realize the Grinch has arrived at the party. We’re in a stupor upon the balustrades. The Grinch is downstairs steal something from somewhere. All the seriousness earlier in lithic flakes; the technical language of cumulonimbus and UV-proof acrylic vitrines is underpinned with a cartoonish charicatures. The Janus-faced visage grins at us as we walk across the bridge. We’re enamored with the intricate reliefs. The details of the crow’s feet around the eyes. Too awe-struck to see the tattered flags for the things they reveal.

I don’t know if it’s intended to critique the hoi polloi’s electric excitement and pulse resonating in this cult of personality they’ve built, but it’s there. The last line delivers the punchline of Rip Torn, face without a name, in a very cartoonish appearance. A halfway Ronald McDonald that echoes the almost marbled mispoken line of the Queen’s Jewels.
